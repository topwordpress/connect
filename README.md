## LinkedIn Automation Script

### Description
This script automates the process of sending connection requests on LinkedIn, including the option to personalize messages for each recipient. It efficiently scrolls through search results, checks for connection buttons, sends requests either with or without a personalized note, and navigates across multiple pages of results. 

### How to Use
1. **Setup**: Copy the script into your browser's developer console while on a LinkedIn search results page.
2. **Configuration**: Adjust the script's configuration at the start (e.g., `scrollDelay`, `actionDelay`, `maxRequests`, and `note` message). 
3. **Execution**: Run the script, and it will automatically scroll through the results, send connection requests, and handle any popup messages that may arise.
4. **Completion**: The script will inform you when it has finished sending requests, including the total number sent.

**Note**: Ensure you allow same-site scripting in your browser for the script to function properly and refer to the provided link for guidance.
